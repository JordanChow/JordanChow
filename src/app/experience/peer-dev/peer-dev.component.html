    </h1>
    <p style="margin-top: 0 !important;">Jan - Apr 2021</p>
    
    <p class="text-container">At PEER Group, I specialized in the web development tech stack, developing a strong
      skill set in web applications and familiarizing myself with REST APIs, HTTP requests, Selenium WebDriver, various 
      front-end technologies, and the MVC design pattern.
    </p>
    <p class="text-container">
      After I had gained exposure to the tech stack and workflow at PEER Group as a QA Specialist, I was given a lot
      more responsibility as a developer. Every bug, task, feature, or new application that I was assigned to, I was
      given complete freedom and control on how I wanted to design and implement it. Therefore, I spearheaded multiple
      new features and applications, working closely with my manager to generate requirements and optimize my solutions.
    </p>
    <p class="text-container">
      This level of ownership over my work, really helped develop my planning and designing abilities, as well as
      independent problem solving abilities. With lots of responsibilities, I learned to adapt many roles - creating
      mockups and UI designs in Figma, generating functional requirements, documenting new features, researching new
      technologies to use, designing database schemas, implementing the back-end, and finally developing the front-end.
    </p>

    <p class="long-text-container">
      Transitioning to the developer role definitely took some time adjusting and becoming familiar with the
      technologies that were used at PEER Group. It was my first time working with a lot of the tools in the web
      development scene. I began with completing an in-depth Udemy course on building an application with ASP.NET
      Core and Angular. This course gave me all the necessary knowledge to design, create, and deploy a web application.

    </h4>
    <p class="text-container">
      Finally, to apply the fundamental skills I learned, I was tasked with creating a lot tracking system. I was given
      complete freedom on how I wanted to implement this, as long as the client's functional requirements were met.
      As a result, I created a web application that serves to track lots processing through a system.

    <p class="text-container">
      This was a great experience to get me comfortable with ASP.NET Core, Angular, SQL Server, and the MVC design
      pattern. Additionally, I was able to practice creating work items and allocating time for each requirement and 
      task. I went through the code review process, discussed requirements with my manager, and presented my final 
      application to the director of engineering. This all served as great exposure to the work environment, making 
      me comfortable with the process for real client projects. I learned a tremendous amount from creating a web 
      application from scratch and I was now ready to transition to bigger tasks.

    <p class="long-text-container">
      I began resolving bugs and implementing small features on our internal website that is used company wide. These bugs
      and tasks helped me get familiar with the codebase and the internal website. I gained exposure to both the backend
      (ASP.NET Core, C#, SQL Server, MVC pattern) and the front end (Angular, Typescript, HTML, CSS, NPM).
    </p>
    
    <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Absence Calendar View</h4>
    <p class="text-container">
      My next task was implementing a major feature - an absence calendar view. This would be a new component in the
      website that allows all employees to view their absences and statutory holidays in a calendar view for any selected 
      year. For managers, they are able to select a team and view all the absences for the employees on that team.
    </p>
    <br>
    <img class="image" src="assets/images/TeamCalendar.gif" alt="Absence Calendar View">
    
    <p class="text-container">
      This feature was crucial to optimize the efficiency of the absence viewing process. With this feature, employees can
      easily see their requests as well as stat holidays. For managers, they can quickly see who on their team will be
      absent when which will help for project management. The new feature will be implemented into production, during the
      next release, impacting all of PEER Group.
    </p>
    
    <p class="long-text-container">
      This component was developed in Angular and leveraged the Clarity UI Design System to help bootstrap the screen. To
      accomplish this, Angular resolvers and services were used to inject data into routes and receive data from the
      backend to be displayed in a user friendly manner. The calendar supports customization for the users in the legend. 
      Any color can be chosen and the default colors can be restored with a reset button.

    <h6>The Problem</h6>
    <hr>
    <p class="text-container" style="margin-top: 10px;">
      The next problem I was faced with was finding a way to upload and download files from an external ticketing site
      (Autodesk PLM). For each ticket, there can be attachments associated with ticket. Due to domain restrictions, these attachments can
      only be downloaded or uploaded from a virtual machine. My job was to find a way to automate the process of downloading
      relevant attachments (based on a customizable query) and upload them to a file share site that can easily be access from PEER's home
      computers. The opposite was also required - PEER employees can upload to the file share site and those files will then get uploaded
      to the correct ticket in the PLM site.
    </p>
    <br>

    <h6>The Solution</h6>
    <hr>
    <p class="long-text-container" style="margin-top: 10px;">
      To solve this problem, I decided to use Selenium WebDriver to simulate a user to access the PLM site, CrushFTP API
      to make HTTP requests for download and upload, and LiteDB to store the file information. The solution is a console 
      application which is run as a script. The script checks the site for new files based on the database and upload or 
      download the necessary files. It was set up to be executed on a scheduled basis on the VM using Window's Task 
      Scheduler.
    </p>
    
    <h4 style="font-weight: bold;">Performance Matrix Review</h4>
    <p class="text-container">
      The final feature I worked on was in the internal website, implementing a new screen. This screen would allow mangers
      to generate performance matrix templates for employee role evaluation. The template would have different criteria and 
      a level to gauge what the expected skill level is for each role (junior, intermediate, senior). There would also be a 
      performance matrix form page, that allows employees and managers to fill out forms and view old forms.
    </p>
    <p class="text-container">
      For this feature, I was responsible for not only the development, but also the planning and designing. I created a 
      Functional Specification document, outlining the requirements for the feature, generated UI mockups in Figma, created
      the database schema using dbdiagram.io, and finally, implemented the engines for the back-end.
